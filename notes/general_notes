- I have the manifest, what if I pull the unique years, group by those years, link the dataframes, then bind rows?
  - 1999-2000 and 1999-2004 are the main groups for that year, the rest are by normal year jumps
  - 2007-2012 goes with 2007
  - disregard 1988-2020


- exceptions to that are 1999-2020 and 1999-2023, those are dietary supplements so I can do that separately

- Create a hyperparameter table to track changes and results
	 - Dataset
	 - Cross-validation setup/training split
	 - model (specific package and name)
	 - hyperparameters for model
	 - results (use a few metrics here)
	 - CI's
